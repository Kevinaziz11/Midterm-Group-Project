***NECESSARY THINGS FOR PROPER PROGRAM EXECUTION***

	1. Class to read and extract the data

	2. Class(es) to store the necessary info (degree type, starting salary, median salary, percentage change, region, etc...)

	3. Class(es) to manipulate the data class(es)

	4. Class to deal with user input (?) TBD
